Manifest File
=============

.. include:: includes/note_keys_required.txt

Resource Containers (RCs) have a ``manifest.yaml`` file that describes its content and structure.
Most of the information adheres to the `Dublin Core Meta Data Initiative <http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms>`_
and can be found nested within the ``dublin_core`` key.
