Identifier
==========

An identifier is a word or a few words that uniquely describe an object.
Identifiers are often used instead of a database id due to their readability and portability.

Syntax
------

Identifiers are composed of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

.. code-block:: none

    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890-

* The first and last characters in an identifier *must* be a letter or a digit (not a hyphen).
